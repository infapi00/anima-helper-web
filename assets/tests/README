This is a directory to dump some custom, mostly functional tests. The
directory contains:

  * tests.js: all the available tests in a monolithic source code
    file. We don't have too many tests right now in any case. If the
    number of tests starts to increase, we could change that.

  * testSpidermonkey.js: command line front-end to run the tests. It
    uses spidermonkey built-in functions for stuff like printing to
    the terminal, loading scripts etc. This should be the only
    javascript file with custom javascript-engine methods. Reference
    here [1][2]

In order to run the tests:
$ js24 testSpidermonkey numTest numSamples

This also prints some info with the available tests.

Disclaimer: all those tests are not really serious. Mostly of them are
custom tests, experiments or just curiosity. Those are not unit tests,
or any other kind of real tests.
